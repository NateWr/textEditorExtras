		<p>Enable the extra controls that you would like to appear in the TinyMCE editor for each field listed below.</p>
		<p>In some cases, adding images, tables or other advanced formatting may cause distribution problems. This is especially
			so in two cases. Advanced formatting in the Email Template Body may not be compatible with all email clients and can
			increase the risk that your emails will be blocked. Advanced formatting in an Abstract may not be compatible with
			indexing services such as Google Scholar, Crossref and the PKP Index.</p>
		<p>Tables present two additional problems. First, wide tables may cause layout problems on small screens. You should test
			any tables you add to your site on a mobile device. Second, most tables require row and column headings in order to be
			compliant with accessibility requirements in many jurisdictions. The table controls that can be enabled here do not
			support proper HTML markup that meets these requirements. You may need to manually adjust the HTML markup of your tables
			according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H51.html">WCAG 2.0 guidelines</a>.</p>
		<p>We encourage you to only add advanced formatting options when it is necessary and to carefully test the results
			wherever your published material is aggregated on other services.</p>]]></message>
